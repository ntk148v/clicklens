# Getting Started

This guide will help you get ClickLens up and running with your ClickHouse database.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## Prerequisites

Before installing ClickLens, ensure you have:

- A running **ClickHouse server** (version 21.8 or later recommended)
- ClickHouse HTTP interface enabled (ports 8123 for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS)
- A ClickHouse user account with appropriate permissions

<Callout type="info">
  ClickLens uses the ClickHouse **HTTP interface** (ports 8123/8443). The native
  TCP protocol (ports 9000/9440) is NOT supported.
</Callout>

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to run ClickLens is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name clicklens \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_HOST=your-clickhouse-host \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123 \
  -e LENS_USER=lensuser \
  -e LENS_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key-here \
  ghcr.io/ntk148v/clicklens:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Option 2: Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/ntk148v/clicklens:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - CLICKHOUSE_HOST=your-clickhouse-host
      - CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123
      - LENS_USER=lensuser
      - LENS_PASSWORD=your-password
      - SESSION_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key-here
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DISABLE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Local Development

For local development with Bun:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ntk148v/clicklens.git
cd clicklens

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment file
cp env.sample .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your ClickHouse connection details
# Then start the development server
bun dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Understanding the Service User

ClickLens uses **two types of ClickHouse connections**:

### 1. Lens Service User (Environment Credentials)

Configured via `LENS_USER` and `LENS_PASSWORD` environment variables. This service account is used for:

- Schema introspection and metadata queries
- System table access for monitoring features
- Background operations that don't require user context

**Recommended minimal grants:**

```sql
CREATE USER lensuser IDENTIFIED BY 'your-password';
GRANT SELECT ON system.* TO lensuser;
GRANT SHOW DATABASES ON *.* TO lensuser;
GRANT SHOW TABLES ON *.* TO lensuser;
GRANT SHOW COLUMNS ON *.* TO lensuser;
```

### 2. User Client (Session Credentials)

When you log in to ClickLens, your ClickHouse username and password are used directly for:

- Executing your SQL queries
- Determining your UI permissions
- All data access operations

<Callout type="warning">
  Your permissions in ClickLens are determined by your ClickHouse user's grants
  and roles. ClickLens does not add or remove permissions—it simply reflects
  what your ClickHouse account can do.
</Callout>

## First Login

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Enter your ClickHouse credentials:
   - **Username**: Your ClickHouse user
   - **Password**: Your ClickHouse password
3. Click **Login**

Upon successful login, you'll be taken to the **Dashboard**.

## The Dashboard

The Dashboard is your starting point in ClickLens. It displays feature cards based on your permissions:

| Feature              | Description                                                  | Required Permission |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **SQL Console**      | Execute queries with syntax highlighting and auto-completion | `canExecuteQueries` |
| **Table Explorer**   | Browse databases, tables, and parts                          | `canBrowseTables`   |
| **Query Monitoring** | Monitor running queries and view history                     | `canViewProcesses`  |
| **Cluster Health**   | CPU, memory, merges, and Keeper status                       | `canViewCluster`    |
| **Access Control**   | Manage users and roles                                       | `canManageUsers`    |
| **Logging**          | View system and query logs                                   | `canViewCluster`    |

<Callout type="info">
  Feature cards are dynamically shown or hidden based on your ClickHouse user's
  permissions. If you're missing expected features, check your ClickHouse
  grants.
