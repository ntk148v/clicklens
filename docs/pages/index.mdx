- **SQL Console** - Write, execute, and analyze queries with syntax highlighting and streaming results
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Keep an eye on your cluster's health, query performance, and resource usage
- **Schema Explorer** - Navigate databases, tables, columns, parts, and more
- **Access Control** - Manage users and roles directly from the UI
- **Native RBAC** - Your UI permissions are derived directly from your ClickHouse grants

## 4. Security Model

<Callout type="info">
  ClickLens adheres to strict RBAC principles. Your UI permissions are derived
  directly from your ClickHouse user's grants—the UI never adds or removes
  permissions.
</Callout>

When you log in:

1. ClickLens authenticates against your ClickHouse server
2. Your grants are queried to determine available features
3. The UI shows only what you have permission to access

This means:

- No separate permission management
- Consistent access between CLI and UI
- Full audit trail in ClickHouse
